# Philter

Philter finds, identifies, and removes sensitive information from text. The docker compose file in this repository will launch the Philter containers. For more information on these containers and how to use them visit https://www.mtnfog.com/products/philter/docker/.

## Docker Compose

To launch the Philter containers:

```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtnfog/philter/master/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up
```

Once the containers have started you can send a sample filter request:

```
curl http://localhost:8080/api/filter --data "George Washington was president and his ssn was 123-45-6789." -H "Content-type: text/plain"
```

Other example requests are available in the [Philter Userâ€™s Guide Quick Start](https://philter.mtnfog.com/introduction/quick-start).

### Configuring Philter
